# CS-330 3D Scene

## About
This project is an OpenGL Scene attempting to replicate some random objects placed on a table.  

## Design Approach
Working on this project has helped me devlop OpenGL and basic 3D design skills. As I was learning this process I resorted to a lot of sketching primities by hand.  Along with the sketches I spent some time exerimenting with approaches to translate these sketches into meshes that could be used by OpenGL.  I belive that taking a bit of time to think about the implementation and put pen to paper or whiteboarding can be used as a viable approach in future projects.

## Development Approach
The development approach was iterative.  The project was developed in phases, gradualying adding more complex shapes.  This approach was critical for the measured success acheived.  Over the course of developing this project my C++ approach became more refined.  I begane refactoring repitious code into common functions and added structs to encapsulate mesh attributes and simplify the code. 

## Applying the new knowledge
Moving forward I can apply the computational graphics and visualizations skills I learned in intersting ways.  For example, these modeling skills can used to design data visulization for desktop and mobile interfaces.  As a professional I can apply these skills to provide cross platform and native applications with rich 3D UX.
